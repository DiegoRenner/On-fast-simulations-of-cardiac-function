Several lumped parameter, or zero-dimensional (0-D), models of the microcirculation are coupled in the time domain to the nonlinear, one-dimensional (1-D)
equations of blood flow in large arteries. A linear analysis of the coupled system, together with in vivo observations, shows that: (i) an inflow resistance that matches the
characteristic impedance of the terminal arteries is required to avoid non-physiological
wave reflections; (ii) periodic mean pressures and flow distributions in large arteries
depend on arterial and peripheral resistances, but not on the compliances and inertias of the system, which only affect instantaneous pressure and flow waveforms; (iii)
peripheral inertias have a minor effect on pulse waveforms under normal conditions;
and (iv) the time constant of the diastolic pressure decay is the same in any 1-D model
artery, if viscous dissipation can be neglected in these arteries, and it depends on all
the peripheral compliances and resistances of the system. Following this analysis, we
propose an algorithm to accurately estimate peripheral resistances and compliances
from in vivo data. This algorithm is verified against numerical data simulated using
a 1-D model network of the 55 largest human arteries, in which the parameters of the
peripheral windkessel outflow models are known a priori. Pressure and flow waveforms in the aorta and the first generation of bifurcations are reproduced with relative
root-mean-square errors smaller than 3%.

        abstract = {One-dimensional numerical models of the arterial vasculature are capable of simulating the physics of pulse wave transmission and reflection. These models are computationally efficient and represents and ideal choice with great translational opportunities in healthcare. However, the use of these models in a patient-specific scenario is hampered by the difficulty in measuring the model inputs (parameters, boundary conditions, and initial conditions) in the clinical setting. As a result, most of the model inputs are noisy or missing, and the inputs uncertainty is transmitted to the model outputs. A fundamental step in the model development consists in performing a sensitivity and uncertainty analysis aimed at understanding how variations on the inputs affect the output variability, with the final aim of instruct the measurement process. A typical sensitivity analysis conducted by means of {$\backslash$}break Monte Carlo sampling is computationally expensive due to the large number of runs required. A novel approach aimed at reducing the computational time consists in using a statistical emulator capable of mimicking mean and variance behaviours of the 1D deterministic model. In this study, emulators built through Gaussian process method are used to predict outcomes of a 1D finite-volume solver for networks of elastic vessels. The 1D model is discussed and validated showing good agreement with published results. The emulator approach for sensitivity analysis is validated against Monte Carlo sampling and a 99.9\% reduction in computational time is obtained. This methodology is further applied in the context of cerebral vasospasm where the sensitivity analysis results are used to identify new biomechanical metrics for this pathology. The novel biomarkers are effective at detecting the cerebral vasospasm better than the currently used one. In particular, the progression of the disease is characterised from an early onset even when the vasospasm is occurring at some distance away from the measurement location.}

abstract = {The accuracy of the nonlinear one-dimensional (1-D) equations of pressure and flow wave propagation in Voigt-type visco-elastic arteries was tested against measurements in a well-defined experimental 1:1 replica of the 37 largest conduit arteries in the human systemic circulation. The parameters required by the numerical algorithm were directly measured in the in vitro setup and no data fitting was involved. The inclusion of wall visco-elasticity in the numerical model reduced the underdamped high-frequency oscillations obtained using a purely elastic tube law, especially in peripheral vessels, which was previously reported in this paper [Matthys et al., 2007. Pulse wave propagation in a model human arterial network: Assessment of 1-D numerical simulations against in vitro measurements. J. Biomech. 40, 3476–3486]. In comparison to the purely elastic model, visco-elasticity significantly reduced the average relative root-mean-square errors between numerical and experimental waveforms over the 70 locations measured in the in vitro model: from 3.0% to 2.5% (p<0.012) for pressure and from 15.7% to 10.8% (p<0.002) for the flow rate. In the frequency domain, average relative errors between numerical and experimental amplitudes from the 5th to the 20th harmonic decreased from 0.7% to 0.5% (p<0.107) for pressure and from 7.0% to 3.3% (p<10−6) for the flow rate. These results provide additional support for the use of 1-D reduced modelling to accurately simulate clinically relevant problems at a reasonable computational cost.}

	Abstract = {Density is defined as mass per unit volume. The classical technique to measure the density of fluids consists of a determination of mass and volume. Blood density is proportional to hematocrit or, more exactly, to the total protein concentration of blood; only to a minor extent is blood density influenced by other plasma solutes. Since the introduction of the mechanical oscillator technique for the continuous recording of fluid density a sizeable amount of experience has accumulated. This review summarizes recent work performed with this technique. It appears that the scientific interest in a variable like blood density depends on the availability of a suitable and simple method. Until the oscillator technique was available the measurement of density was too complicated or too inaccurate for routine laboratory use. A further new technique permits us to determine fluid densities by measuring sound velocity transmission. The density dilution method can be used for the determination of distribution volumes, of flow through organs, and of the cardiac output. The influence of temperature and of certain artifacts like acceleration forces in the density measuring device have to be considered any may be used for additional diagnostic purposes like determination of erythrocyte sedimentation velocity. The new technique opens a reasonable simple way to study fluid shift between interstitial space and capillaries. The arterio-venous density gradient in an organ depends on the lymph production. The injection of a hypertonic solution leads to an osmotic fluid shift from the extravascular space towards the blood. This fluid shift can be recognized by a reduction of the blood density. A simple model for the description of this reaction is presented.},
