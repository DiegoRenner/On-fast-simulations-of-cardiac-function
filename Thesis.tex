\chapter{Introduction}
\chapter{Cardiovascular System}
This section serves as an overview of the cardiovascular system with a focus on the arteries of the systemic circulation. 
Section \ref{mbb} will describe the main building blocks of the cardiovascular system and their relation, section \ref{aw} will give the characteristics of the arterial walls, and section \ref{b} the characteristics of blood.
\section{Main Building Blocks} \label{mbb}
The cardiovascular system contains two major circulations.
These are the systemic and the pulmonary circulation. 
Both are fed with blood pumped from the heart.
Through the systemic circulation organs are supplied with oxygen-rich blood which is then transported back to the heart where it then enters the pulmonary circulation.
Through the pulmonary circulation the oxygen-poor blood is sent to the lungs where it is replenished with oxygen and then returned to the heart to reenter the systemic circulation.
Vessels carrying the blood away from the heart are referred to as arteries and the ones carrying the blood to the heart are referred to as veins.
In both the systemic and the pulmonary circulation the oxygen exchange (from blood to organs or from lungs to blood respectively) take place within so called capillary vessels.
Capillaries are very small vessels that connect arteries to veins.
From here on out our main focus will be on on the arteries of the systemic circulation. 
In the next two subsections we will describe the main characteristics of the arterial walls and the blood flowing within respectively.

\section{Arterial Wall} \label{aw}
An arterial wall consists of three layers or tunicae: an inner, middle, and outer layer also referred to as intima, media, and adventita respectively.
The tunica intima lines the inside of the artery. It is made up of a single layer of endothelial cells encased in a thin layer of elastin and collagen fibres (connective tissue). 
On the outside of the artery the tunica adventita is made up of connective tissue as well which attaches the artery to surounding connective tissue.
Inbetween these two layers lies the thickest layer, the tunica media, which consists of elastic fibres and muscle cells. 
The tunica media is responsible for the elasticity of the artery.
Arteries close to the heart have a tunica media that is mainly made up of elastic fibres and are referred to as elastic arteries while the tunica media of arteries farther away from the heart and of small arteries consist predominently of muscle cells and are called muscular arteris.
On the topic of elasticity or elastance, the tendency of a hollow organ to recoil toward its original dimensions upon removal of a distending or compressing force, we also have compliance, the ability of a hollow organ (vessel) to distend and increase volume with increasing transmural pressure or the tendency of a hollow organ to resist recoil toward its original dimensions on application of a distending or compressing force.
The elastic arteries have a higher compliance and will deform more under pressure than the muscular arteries that are stiffer.
At the same time usually the elastic arteries are larger than the muscular arteries since the size of arteries generally descends as the distnce to the heart increases.
The compliance of these larger elastic arteries is responsible for transforming the pulsatile flow at the heart into a constant flow at the capillaries.
The pulse-like pressure change coming from the heart leads to the elastic arteries close to the heart expanding.
Until the next pulse arrives these vessels will contract again, pushing the blood at a constant rate into the arteries farther away from the heart and finally into the capillaries.
This mechanism is called the Windkessel effect.
It is named after the inner workings of waterpumps used by early fire brigades.
In these devices water would be pumped by hand from the reservoir causing pressure pulses.
This would push water into an air chamber.
Here the air would get compressed which is analogous to the deforming of the artery.
The natural decompressing of the air would then push thhe water out through the hose in a steady manner, just like the contracting of the artery would push out the blood.
We call the radius of an artery in it's undeformed state the lumen radius $R_0$.

\section{Blood} \label{b}

Blood consists of red blood cells (Erythocytes), white blood cells (Leukocytes), and platelets (Thrombocytes).
The Erythocytes make up about 97\% of the cellular volume.
They are flexible, can bind to oneanother, and their micro-structure determines the blood mechanical properties.
The volume occupied by red blood cells in respect to the total blood volume is called the haematocrit value.
At different age, altitude, health, and bodily activity the haematocrit value varies.
The blood dynamic viscosity $\mu$ decreases hyperbolically with the shear rate $\gamma$.
At about $\gamma > 100s^{-1}$ the viscosity stays constant for common haematocrit values.
In larger arteries the average shear rate close to the walls is above this threshold.
Therefore blood can roughly be considered a Newtonian fluid.
Blood density $\rho$ is constant within the range of $1050 \pm 10 \text{ kg}\cdot\text{m}^{-3}$.
